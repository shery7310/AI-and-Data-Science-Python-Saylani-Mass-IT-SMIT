    <h1>Artifical Intelligence and Data Science Course by Saylani Mass IT Training Institute (SMIT) - Saylani-AI-Batch2 (Faisalabad)</h1>

<p>This course is being taught by <a href="https://github.com/Ahmadjajja">Sir Ahmed Jajja</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ahmadjajja/AI_n_DataScience">this</a> is the original repository that my instructor created on 1st of October 2024. This is an Advance Artificial Intelligent and Data Science Course the Saylani Welfare is teaching for absolutely free </p>

<p>This is a course aimed at absolute beginners and I say this as a student of Saylani that it's better than even paid courses by institutes in Pakistan. Saylani is offering this absolutely free, the course is worth hundreds of dollars and they are making careers out of students. The instructor who is the first teacher of this course has been a Section Leader at Standford's code in Place and a number of other international hackathons is determined to make us grind in Leetcode, he has also Co-Founded a Software House and also worked as Full Stack Developer.</p>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence Course Duration</h2>

<p>This is a one-year program designed for absolute beginners who are passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Preparing Pakistan for the new era of computing driven by the rise of AI.</p>

<h4>How can students benefit from this?</h4>

<p>If you're eager to learn Python, you can explore the assignments folder and try solving the questions on your own. If you're unable to complete a question, you can refer to the solutions I've provided. This AI program covers skills such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. You'll always find code examples and solutions available in my repository.</p>
